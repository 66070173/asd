            Let youself be sad, let yourself be a mess. But promise yourself that you'll try harder each day.That's all you can do. Take it day by day you'll learn that all this time maybe you deserved more.A beautiful thing happens when you give your hert time to heal itself. You find happiness again, and when you do, you know it because how far you've come when you thought you'd lost all hope, And if that's not something to look forward to, find it!
